Hello Abdullah,

It was a pleasure to meet you!

Here is the programming challenge:

I would like for you to build a webpage + a mock API (it can be simple JSON files, no need for a server) that shows a list of cars, an individual car, and allows to book a car.Each car should have the following properties
•	Make
•	Model
•	Kilometers Traveled
•	Latitude
•	Longitude
•	Images (an array of URLs, you can just grab URLs from the web, no need for a server)
•	Available From (DateTime)
•	Available Until (DateTime)

Please develop the following:
1.	Create a page where all cars within 50 KM from a fixed point (this can be hardcoded) can be viewed.
a.	Display all the car properties
b.	Display the first image of the car only
2.	Upon clicking on a car, I should be taken to a page that shows me the individual car’s details, along with a slider that paginates between all car images.
a.	There should be a button that allows me to book the car
3.	Booking Page
a.	This should be a simple form where I can select the start and end date of my booking
b.	If the car is available (meaning the date range is >= Available From and <= Available Until), show an alert that says. “Car Booked Successfully"
c.	If the car is not available, show an error saying that the car is not available in the selected range, please select a range from AvailableFrom to AvailableUntil.
d.	Bonus Goal: This isn’t the greatest UX, improve the above that the UI only shows you the available dates and grays out the unavailable dates and makes them un-selectable.
You’re free to use any JavaScript packages or frameworks, and any CSS frameworks

Bonus Goal
Convert the mock API to a Ruby on Rails app following Rails conventions, make sure to use ActiveStorage for image storage.
